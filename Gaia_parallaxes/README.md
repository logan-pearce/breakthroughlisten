* Computing distance with Gaia parallaxes tutorial.ipynb: Jupyter notebook walking through how to use Gaia parallaxes to estimate distance using Bayesian methodology.  Adapted from the methods and R code of Bailer-Jones et. al. 2015.
* Data Quality and Gaia Archive tutorial.ipynb: Jupyter notebook exploring the impact that the precision of the parallax measurements have on the distance estimation from Gaia parallaxes.  Presents the rationale for the data quality filters applied in this project.  Adapted from Bailer-Jones et. al. 2015 and Gaia Collaboration 2018 (arXiv:1804.09378)
