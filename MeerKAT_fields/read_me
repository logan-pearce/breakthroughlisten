  Computing the distances, std dev, and temp/sptype for all the individual sources from the SQL database (ala 
  "compute_distances_mhongoose.py etc) took entirely too long.  The script "compute_master_distances_teffs.py does the 
  computations on the compute cluster side, then use send_to_sql.py to send the csv's to a whole new table on the SQL server.
